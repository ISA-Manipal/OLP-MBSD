## RSB:
Reverse Sub is similar to SUB but varies in its orientation. It helps us to acheive logical + Arthematic operation in a single piece of code i.e. Rd = (R0 << 6) - R1, Instead of using a MOV , LSL and SUB instructions there by reduces time complexity. It also helps in reaching NUMs below and above 0 comfortablly I.e. both sides of the number line of 0.
