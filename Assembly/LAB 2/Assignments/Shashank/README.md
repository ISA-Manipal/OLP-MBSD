**Q1.** WAP to add two 96-bit integers. (Check Addition96.s)

**Q2.** WAP to subtract two 64-bit integers. (Check Subtraction64.s)

**Q3.** Why define a new operation RSB, when SUB can suffice?
(The difference between SUB and RSB is that operand 2 is now being subtracted from. In `RSB rd, op1, op2`, we get `rd = op2 - op1`. Where as `SUB rd, op1, op2` the result is `rd = op1 - op2`.)

**Q4.** Suresh has a habit of reverse subtraction, one day he went to retailer store to buy a packet of milk for rupees 18/- and chocolate for rupees 20/-. 
He gave rupees 100/- to the shopkeeper and asked for rupees 3536/-. Check in debugging whether Suresh's calculations were correct or wrong. (Check SureshQ4.s)
