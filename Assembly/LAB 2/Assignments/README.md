*(Mention all the theoretical answers in your README)*

**Q1.** WAP to find the 1's complement of a given number x.

**Q2.** WAP to invert bits 0-2 of x.

**Q3.** Write an assembly language to connect four sensors in two sub systems. Create a logic for the system with given condition.
        The First system holds one sensor interfaced with R0 register.
        Second System holds 3 sensors interfaced with R3, R4 & R5 registers.
        If all the sensors are high in input then make R7 Register high which is interfaced with the wheels of a vehicle
